    response: "CoinNet Inc., commonly known as CoinNet, is a U.S.-based digital asset investment company founded in 2017. It specializes in tokenized revenue-sharing models, allowing users to purchase digital investment units—often described as “shares”—linked to the performance of leading e-commerce and tech platforms such as Amazon, Shopify, eBay, and more. CoinNet’s innovative framework enables users to invest using cryptocurrency and receive automated daily rewards. The story of CoinNet begins in late 2016, when three American software engineers — Daniel Harper, Melissa O’Connor, and Brian Chao — were working on blockchain payment integrations for e-commerce stores. They noticed a gap in the market: People wanted to invest in the growth of online marketplaces without buying actual company stock. At the time, traditional fractional shares were still new, and cryptocurrency adoption was accelerating. The founders envisioned a system where crypto users could: 1) Buy digital investment units linked to marketplace data and Earn daily profits based on performance metrics like traffic, sales volume, and vendor activity, 2) Invest instantly with cryptocurrency. In February 2017, they incorporated CoinNet Technologies Inc. in Delaware."

    response: "CoinNet provides new users with a $500 Portfolio Reward as a welcome gift. This balance is added automatically when a user creates and verifies their account. --- 1. What Is the CoinNet Portfolio Reward? The Portfolio Reward is a one-time $500 welcome bonus given to new users when they join CoinNet. This reward: Does NOT come from the user, Does NOT require a deposit, Does NOT participate in investments, Does NOT generate daily profits, Is NOT used to buy shares, It is simply a platform gift added to the user’s dashboard. --- 2. Purpose of the Portfolio Reward. The purpose of the reward is to: Welcome new users, Encourage them to start using the platform, Increase their total dashboard balance, Support them as they begin investing, Make withdrawals easier when requirements are met, It serves as an extra balance that belongs to the user, but only under specific withdrawal conditions. --- 3. Withdrawal Rules for the Portfolio Reward. The $500 welcome reward cannot be withdrawn alone. It must be withdrawn together with the user’s main balance. ✔ You can withdraw it only when: You have invested your own money. You have an available balance (profits or deposits) You meet the minimum withdrawal requirement ✖ You cannot withdraw it if: You try to withdraw the reward by itself You have no main balance, You have not invested anything. The reward is locked until you have real account activity. --- 4. Example of How Withdrawal Works. Let’s say your account shows: Available Balance: $150, Portfolio Reward: $500, Total Dashboard Balance: $650, You can withdraw: $650, You cannot withdraw: $500 (reward only),You cannot withdraw: $150 (main balance only) The withdrawal must include both together. --- 5. Where the Reward Appears is In the user’s dashboard: Go to Portfolio You will see: Main Balance Portfolio Reward: $500 Total Balance. The reward is displayed clearly but kept separate so users understand it is not investable. --- 6. Key Points to Remember: The portfolio reward is a gift, not an investment tool, You cannot use it to buy shares, You cannot reinvest it, You cannot withdraw it alone, You can withdraw it only together with your actual balance, It helps users reach the withdrawal threshold faster"
